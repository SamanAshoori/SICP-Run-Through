## About This Repository

This repository records my self-study journey through the computer science classic, **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs**.

Although I am currently enrolled in a Computer Science program, I decided to tackle SICP in my spare time. My goal is to deepen my understanding of functional programming, abstraction, and the fundamental nature of computation beyond what is covered in my standard university curriculum.

## The Environment

I am using **DrRacket** to work through the exercises.

* **Language:** Scheme (Racket)
* **IDE:** DrRacket
* **Primary Lectures:** [UC Berkeley CS 61A (Spring 2011)](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/sp11/](https://archive.org/details/ucberkeley-webcast-PL3E89002AA9B9879E?sort=titleSorter)) by Brian Harvey.
* **Textbook:** [SICP (HTML Version)](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html)
